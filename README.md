### reborn_web

In `settings.py`, language code, timezone, templates path, static path, media path setting, etc. are done. Add the created app to installed_app and Match the url.py for each app in the url.py path within this directory.

### users

This is the user account app. We implemented functions such as basic login, membership, authentication using SMTP, profile modification, ID/password finding with Ajax, password change, and membership withdrawal.

### notice

This is the department announcement app. Only accounts with administrator rights can be CRUD, and features such as searching for postings and displaying notices have been added.

### free

It's a free bulletin board app. We added categories such as questions and information, and unlike the notice app, we added functions such as comment and reply with Ajax.

### anonymous

It's an anonymous bulletin board app. This is an infinite scroll-type bulletin board with the motif of Facebook Timeline and Everytime. The author is anonymous and has added features such as recommendation.

### calender

It's a course schedule app. Only accounts with administrator rights can add, delete, and modify schedules, and the schedule was implemented in the D-Day format using query statements on the index page.

### timetable

This is the department test timetable app. You can view the exam schedule in a table format by selecting only the exam schedule by grade and the subjects you take. Users with administrator privileges can update the test schedule and have implemented it to display the last update time.

It is an app that adds functions such as student council information, club in department, and laboratory introduction.
